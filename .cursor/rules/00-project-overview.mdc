description: Core engineering conventions for menofhunger-api (NestJS + Prisma).
---

## Primary goals
- Keep changes **small, composable, and testable** (SOLID/DRY).
- Prefer **clear domain boundaries** over cleverness.
- Always ship changes with **good migration hygiene** and predictable API payloads.

## API contract (must follow)
- **Success**: always return `{ data: ... }` (or `{ data, ... }` if extra top-level fields are intentionally included).
- **Failure**: must be `meta.errors[]` envelope (handled by the global exception filter).
- Do not reintroduce `ok: true/false` response patterns.

## Auth + admin security
- Auth uses **HTTP-only cookies**; always set `credentials: include` on clients.
- Admin routes must be **hidden** from non-admins:
  - For admin-only controllers/guards: return **404** (NotFound) instead of 401/403 where required by product behavior.
- Do not leak sensitive flags or internal fields via public endpoints.

## Prisma / DB rules (high priority)
- Any schema change requires:
  - update `prisma/schema.prisma`
  - add a **SQL migration** under `prisma/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_name/migration.sql`
  - run `npx prisma migrate deploy` (local) and `npx prisma generate`
- Prefer DB-enforced constraints:
  - add indices for query paths (filter/sort keys)
  - use unique constraints for identity fields (phone, username)
- If you add a new user-facing query, consider indexing and pagination up front.

## DTOs + mapping
- Controllers should return DTOs, not raw Prisma models.
- Reuse mapping helpers (e.g. `toUserDto`) and do not duplicate user “shape” mapping across controllers.
- Keep DTOs stable; only widen payloads intentionally.

## Validation + errors
- Validate request bodies with Zod; reject invalid inputs with clear messages.
- Normalize phone numbers via shared helpers (`normalizePhone`).
- For uniqueness conflicts, catch Prisma codes and throw a specific, user-readable error.

## Code structure
- Keep feature code in `src/modules/<feature>/` with:
  - controller (thin)
  - service (business logic)
  - guards/decorators/utilities extracted as needed
- Avoid cross-module imports except through a module boundary (exports/providers).

## Workflow expectations
- After substantive changes:
  - `npm run build`
  - run migrations/generate as needed
- Do not add dependencies unless truly needed; prefer existing stack.
